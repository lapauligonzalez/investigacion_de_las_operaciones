# Coursework for the course "Operations Research"

Throughout the "Operations Research" course, we tackled real-world problems by applying key tools and concepts such as linear programming, optimization models, transportation and assignment networks, and scheduling and crashing techniques. We used software like Solver and LINGO to model and solve situations related to logistics, production, inventory management, and strategic planning, developing mathematical models that maximize or minimize objective functions under multiple constraints.
